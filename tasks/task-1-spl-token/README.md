# Task 1 — SPL Token Minting

This task focuses on creating and minting an SPL token using Solana tooling.

## What I did
- Followed the task instructions to create an SPL token
- Understood the relationship between mint accounts and token accounts
- Practiced interacting with Solana CLI and basic on-chain operations

## Key Learnings
- Token-related state lives in accounts, not in programs
- Ownership and authority design is critical even for simple token flows
