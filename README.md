# Solana Developer Training Camp 2026

This repository documents my participation in the Solana Developer Training Camp (Season 1, 2026).

It contains task submissions, learning artifacts, and reflections produced during the program.
The focus is on understanding Solana’s execution model, account structure, and system-level constraints,
rather than building production-ready applications.

## Structure
- `/tasks`: Task submissions and related files
- `/reflections`: Learning notes and overall reflections
